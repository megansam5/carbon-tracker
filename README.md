# Carbon Tracker ðŸŒ±

**Carbon Tracker** is a simple web app built with **Next.js, React, TypeScript, TailwindCSS, Recharts, and Framer Motion** that lets users track their carbon footprint from daily activities.  
The app allows you to add activities, see the emissions in a list, and visualize your impact with a responsive pie chart. It then suggests some tips to decrease your carbon footprint based on the activity with the highest emmission.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).
